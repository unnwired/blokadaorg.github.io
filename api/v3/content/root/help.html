<h4><a name="howitworks">How does Blokada work?</a></h4>
<p>Blokada is a thin layer between the network interface (wifi or mobile) of your phone and the application/s you use. To be able to filter every outgoing traffic, it generates a VPN connection and simply blocks any requests towards the hosts defined in the blacklist filters. This blocking is done with a redirection, the IP address of the website which serves the advertisement will be resolved by the phone to a local IP address (127.0.0.1), where no web service is running, therefore nothing will be shown. With this, Blokada saves both your data plan and battery life. The filters are updated automatically and contain hosts known for serving ads, tracking, spam, malware, and other unwanted or dangerous content. You can configure Blokada with your own custom filters and whitelists to ensure the service which you would like to use isn’t blocked and you don’t experience any interruption.</p>

<h4><a name="vpn">Can I use another VPN while Blokada is turned on?</a></h4>
<p>Unfortunately no. You can have only one active VPN connection at a time, if you join to an other service, Blokada will exit.</p>

<h4><a name="options">What are the options in Blokada?</a></h4>
<p>The following options are available in Blokada:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Blacklist</b>: lists of host files containing the hosts to block. Please note that using multiple lists can have effect on network and system speed.</li>
    <li><b>Whitelist</b>: here you can define hosts which should not be blocked or apps where Blokada won’t filter URLs. Blokada is installed with several whitelisted apps by default.</li>
    <li><b>Keep alive</b>: this option is to ensure Blokada is not paused or stopped by the system. Please note your system can overwrite it, make sure your settings will let Blokada run in the background.</li>
    <li><b>Notifications</b>: when enabled, you will be notified when an ad is blocked.</li>
    <li><b>Online only</b>: when enabled, Blokada will exit if there is no active connection, and start again whenever connection comes back. If disabled, Blokada will always run in the background (even if no network is available). Please note this option may not work on every device.</li>
    <li><b>Start on boot</b>: when enabled, Blokada will start after the system boots up. Please note there are system level configurations for this option, therefore it cannot be guaranteed Blokada can start on boot. In this case, please check your phone’s settings.</li>
</ul></p>

<h4><a name="ads">What can I do if I still see some ads?</a></h4>
<p>Some ads will come through with any ad blocker on Android. In particular YouTube ads or some fullscreen popup ads are difficult to block. If you think more ads are coming through than before, try these steps:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Check if the VPN key icon is present in the status bar at the top. If not, start Blokada.</li>
    <li>Open Blokada and check if it is active and not reporting any errors.</li>
    <li>Check if the hosts counter is not equal to zero. If it is, select some blacklist filters so that ads can be blocked. If the counter is still zero, report a bug.</li>
    <li>Make sure you don't have too many apps in the whitelist - maybe that's why you are seeing ads.</li>
    <li>Try resetting your filters (go to the Blacklist screen and choose "Restore Defaults" from the Quick Actions menu at the top).</li>
    <li>If you see ads in your browser, deactive any kind of traffic compression or optimisation in the browser's settings.</li>
    <li>Deactivate Blokada, close it (by swiping it out from the Recents screen), and turn it on again.</li>
    <li>If you recently changed your settings (filters, whitelist, etc), remember it takes time before new configuration start working. Give it some time.</li>
    <li>Clear app data for Blokada (in system settings), or reinstall it.</li>
    <li>Restart your device.</li>
    <li>Your device may be unsupported. Please check <a href="http://go.blokada.org/issue_device">Devices Database</a>.</li>
    <li>If none of those steps helped, please report a bug (see below).</li>
</ul></p>

<h4><a name="kill">What can I do if Blokada stops working after a while?</a></h4>
<p><ul>
    <li>Turn on "Keep Alive" in Blokada.</li>
    <li>Go to system settings and disable any kind of battery optimisation for Blokada.</li>
    <li>If you are using memory cleaners, or any other apps of this sort, make sure Blokada is whitelisted.</li>
    <li>Your device may be unsupported. Please check <a href="http://go.blokada.org/issue_device">Devices Database</a>.</li>
    <li>If none of those steps helped, please report a bug (see below).</li>
</ul></p>

<h4><a name="unsupported">I have problems starting Blokada, what can I do?</a></h4>
<p><ul>
    <li>Restart your device.</li>
    <li>Uninstall Blokada and install it again.</li>
    <li>Your device may be unsupported. Please check <a href="http://go.blokada.org/issue_device">Devices Database</a>.</li>
    <li>If none of those steps helped, please report a bug (see below).</li>
</ul></p>

<h4><a name="update">I cannot install an update, what can I do?</a></h4>
<p><ul>
    <li>Restart your device.</li>
    <li>Uninstall Blokada and install it again.</li>
    <li>Your device may be unsupported. Please check <a href="http://go.blokada.org/issue_device">Devices Database</a>.</li>
    <li>If none of those steps helped, please report a bug (see below).</li>
</ul></p>

<h4><a name="notification">Can I hide the VPN notification?</a></h4>
<p>Unfortunately no. Some devices may be displaying annoying VPN notification while VPN is active, and it is not possible to hide it. If you can, try updating your device, since newer Android versions do not have this problem.</p>

<h4><a name="bug">How do I report a problem, idea or suggestion?</a></h4>
<p>If you are experiencing problems, just choose the <b>Feedback</b> option from the menu in top right corner and follow the instructions. Please provide as much information as you can and steps to reproduce the same issue - it helps greatly in fixing your problem! If you are a pro user, you can go directly to the issue tracker at Github.</p>

<h4><a name="private">Can Blokada see my private data?</a></h4>
<p>No. Blokada does not read or tamper with your private information. Blokada only monitors which hosts your device is making requests towards and blocks the ones matching the filters. Every time Blokada blocks anything, you will see a notification (which you can turn off). Blokada has no access to your encrypted trafic.</p>

<h4><a name="battery">Does Blokada use a lot of battery?</a></h4>
<p>No. Depending on your settings the battery impact is minimal, and on most new devices, especially on Marshmallow (Android 6) or newer, you will not notice any battery drain. However, some unlucky devices may experience increased battery drain. Refer to the <a href="http://go.blokada.org/issue_device">Devices Database</a> for details.</p>

<h4><a name="speed">Will Blokada slow down my device?</a></h4>
<p>No. Depending on your settings Blokada can be quite efficient. In fact, both your device's performance and battery life may visibly improve, because Blokada saves your device from downloading and processing content you don't need or care about. However, users with some older devices may experience performance drop. Refer to the <a href="http://go.blokada.org/issue_device">Devices Database</a> for details.</p>

<h4><a name="free">Is Blokada really free to use?</a></h4>
<p>Yes! Blokada started as my hobby project, is still mostly developed by me. It's my way of giving back to the community. Blokada is fully open source and it will stay free forever. That said, developing it takes a lot of time, so please consider supporting the project in any way you can (see below).</p>

<h4><a name="contribute">Blokada is great, how can I help the project?</a></h4>
<p>There are many ways to support Blokada, financially or else. All means of help are very important for the project to exist. <a href="contribute.html">Please go to this page for more information</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="other">I have another question, where can I ask it?</a></h4>
<p>If your question is not answered here, please use the Feedback option from the top menu. If you have a more technical question, please go directly to the tracker at GitHub.</p>
